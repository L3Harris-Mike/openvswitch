Subject: [PATCH branch-2.3] flow: Fix buffer overflow for crafted MPLS packets.

A bug in MPLS parsing could cause a crafted MPLS packet to overflow the
buffer reserved for MPLS labels in the OVS internal flow structure.  This
fixes the problem.

This commit also fixes a secondary problem where an MPLS packet with zero
labels could cause an out-of-range shift that would overwrite memory.
There is no obvious way to control the data used in the overwrite, so this
is harder to exploit.
